!Woz is not a standalone emulator program!

If you don't own an Apple //e|//c|//gs system and don't use one
at work then you can:
> Format this disk ... for a more useful work,
> Write to Apple U.K. to encourage them giving me the permission to
  include the Firmware on disk for distribution in U.K.,
> Stay tuned.   
Otherwise please consult the manual file in the Doc directory for further
details

!Woz is a freeware program.

Freeware means that you can freely distribute the emulator provided
that the entire set of files is included. You should not make any profit
by distributing it.
